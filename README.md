# SHA-256

Console implementation of the famous SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) made as a Course project for the "Introduction to Programming" Course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, part of Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski"
<br/><br/>

## Student Information
- **Name:** Slavi Rezashki
- **Faculty ID:** 6MI0600339
- **Undergraduate Program:** Software Engineering at FMI of Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski"
- **Semester:** 1

## Compilation and Running
**Compilation:**
- If using g++ run `g++ -std=c++20 lib/*.cpp SHA256.cpp -o SHA256.exe` (or .out) inside `./SHA-256` project directory
- If using clang++ run `clang++ -std=c++20 lib/*.cpp SHA256.cpp -o SHA256.exe` (or .out) inside `./SHA-256` project directory

**Running**
- Run `./SHA256.exe` (or .out) in the project directory
<br/><br/>

## Features
- Generate SHA-256 message in `sha256_output.txt` by entering your desired message in `sha256_input.txt`, located in the `./SHA-256` project directory
- Compare your SHA-256 hashed message with the one generated by the SHA-256 Algorithm
