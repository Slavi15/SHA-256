# SHA-256

Console implementation of the famous SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) made as a Course project for the "Introduction to Programming" Course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, part of Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski"
<br/><br/>

## Compilation and Running
**Compilation:**
- If using g++ run `g++ -Wall -std=c++20 SHA-256/SHA256.cpp -o SHA256.exe` (or .out)
- If using clang++ run `clang++ -Wall -std=c++20 SHA-256/SHA256.cpp -o SHA256.exe` (or .out)

**Running**
- Run `./SHA256.exe` (or .out) in the project directory
<br/><br/>

## Usage
- Enter your desired message in `sha256_input.txt` to be hashed with SHA-256, located in the `./SHA-256` project directory
- Your SHA-256 message will be available in `sha256_output.txt`, located  in the `./SHA-256` project directory
